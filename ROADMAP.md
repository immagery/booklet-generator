---------------------------------

* Read properly all the text using the configurations and organize in dictionaries

* explore how scribus defines the templates, it should be XML files, easy to read.
* explore how scribus ends up creating text files that we could reopen in there.
* read the templates in a format that is usable

* build scribus doc using the dicitionaries and scribus templates 
* explore how scribus exports PDF from those text files.

* figure out the creation of the different kinds of docs:
   - digital for website
   - digital for print
   - booklet to print at home
